This webapp ressembles one of the parts of the project of the Sino-Spanish Campus 2025: Fuxing Island Design. Our proposal included an app that works as a social media, encouraging the people to go to the island and tracking your activities there.

For installing the requirements:
    make setup

For compiling the sass:
    make css

For running the webapp on port 5100:
    make run

Remember that for building the sass with bulma you will need to run beforehand
    npm init -y
    npm install sass
    npm install bulma
